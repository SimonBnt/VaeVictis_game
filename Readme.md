-- VaeVictis --
-- Dark fantasy Pixel art action roguelike rpg --

VaeVictis is a project that’s been close to my heart for quite some time now. All the ideas and inspirations I’ve collected in my head are finally starting to take shape ever since I began developing the game using Lua and LÖVE2D.

If I had to categorize VaeVictis, I’d say it’s an action roguelike RPG set in a dark fantasy universe inspired by Berserk, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls, brought to life in pixel art.

For the game’s design, I draw inspiration from titles like Vampire Survivors, Risk of Rain, Bloodborne, Slay the Spire, Noita, and many others. I borrow small bits of gameplay and ideas that personally struck me, elements that might seem minor, but give that addictive “just one more run” feeling and make the gameplay truly fun.

One of my goals with VaeVictis is to create near-infinite replayability, allowing you to embark on ever more challenging and varied monster-hunting expeditions. While balancing a game is always a difficult task, I aim to make it as hardcore as possible. Your hero will grow stronger throughout each expedition—but the game will never go easy on you. The idea is that you get better, not that the game gets easier.

If you want to know more about VaeVictis and follow future updates, check out the todo.txt file right here in the repository. You can also follow me on social media (coming soon), the official VaeVictis website (coming soon), or the game’s pages on itch.io and Steam (coming soon), where I will regularly post devlogs.

Don’t forget to wishlist and follow the project . It really helps spread the word and gives me valuable feedback to keep improving the game, and to craft an experience that’s always more fun, challenging, and rewarding.

A demo will also be available soon on Steam. Feel free to download it, give it a try, die a few times, and share your thoughts on the game!

-- A little bit of scenario --

"You play as a wandering monster hunter, a lone mercenary roaming a world ravaged by the 'Miasma.' Every expedition is a fight for survival: track down nightmarish creatures, harvest their precious resources, and sell them to upgrade your gear and hone your combat skills.

But this cycle of hunting and trading comes at a cost. The farther you venture, the deadlier the monsters become. The world itself is a relentless enemy—the Miasma corrupts everything it touches, turning life into savage abominations eager to tear you apart.

Traverse these tainted lands with your sword, your shield, and your 'Mana Lamp,' powered by rare crystals that allow you to survive in the Miasma. But for how long? Remember to recharge it… or your fate is sealed. Or worse.

Kill, trade, survive… until death finally catches up to you."
